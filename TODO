* experiment with adding newly discovered constraints on the fly; this increases number of variables and might require too many computations
* "global" solver mode: add all unknown cells, add constraint row which sums all them up to a number of remaining mines
* when simplex-based solver can't proceed, calculate/display probability of a mine under each uncovered cell
* do simplex on sub-segments: smaller LPs solve quicker
* see if we maximize first would work faster
* use all threads; would have to copy GLP instances into isolated processes
* try glpk's MIP
* see if setting a vairable to 0 and testing for feasibility is quicker
